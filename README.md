## Description

A website that hosts a game similar to GeoGuessr. It will spawn a user in
a random location within Gainesville and the user will have to guess where
they are on a map, and points will be rewarded based on how close their
guess was to their dropped off location.

## Requirements

To run the server, you must set `DB_PASSWORD` to be the password for the database you are using as well as `COOKIE_SECRET` for encoding and decoding cookies.

## Cypress

Install Cypress using `npm install cypress --save-dev`, Cypress and the frontend unit tests can be accessed using `.\node_modules\.bin\cypress open`. Make sure to select e2e testing to view and run the avaliable unit tests.
